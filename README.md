# 🌟 Image Organizer & Classifier 🔍

Welcome to the **Image Organizer & Classifier** repository! 🚀  
This project leverages **Deep Learning** to efficiently **classify, organize, and analyze images** for various use cases, including:  
📸 Assisting journalists with image management  
🔥 Identifying fire hazards from images  
🐾 Supporting veterinarians in determining animal breeds

## ❤️ Acknowledgments  

Special thanks to **PyTorch**, **ResNet**, and the **open-source community** for their incredible tools and resources.  


## 🚀 How It Works  

1. **Upload Images**: The model accepts batches of images.  
2. **Feature Extraction**: Automatically identifies patterns using convolutional layers.  
3. **Classification**: Groups images into predefined categories.  
4. **Organized Output**: Generates a structured gallery.  

### 💡 Applications:  
- **Journalism**: Categorize large photo collections for easier reporting.  
- **Safety**: Detect potential fire hazards from drone or surveillance images.  
- **Veterinary**: Assist in identifying animal breeds from photos.
